# Abstract

In 1994, Shor's Algorithm was designed by American mathematician Peter Shor to be a quantum algorithm that can very quickly find the prime factors of large integers which is the core of public-key cryptography used in modern day data encryption. The algorithm uses Euler's Theorem to improve the guesses of the factors. The theorem states that for coprime integers $a, b$
$$ a^p = mb + 1 $$
for some integers $p$ and $m$.

In this presentation, I will briefly describe Shor's Algorithm and explain why it is able to break existing public-key encryption schemes then move on to prove Euler's Theorem which seems to be possible using Group Theory and Lagrange's Theorem.
