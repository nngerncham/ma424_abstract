# Abstract

In 1994, Shor's Algorithm was designed by American mathematician Peter Shor to be a quantum algorithm that can very quickly find the prime factors of large integers which is the core of public-key cryptography used in modern day data encryption. The algorithm itself uses a handful results from Number Theory and Quantum Mechanics which I think may be interesting to share.

In the presentation, I will describe Shor's Algorithm and all the results used in order for the algorithm to work and briefly mention about the recent results that have come out in order to combat this algorithm.
